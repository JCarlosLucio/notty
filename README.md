# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## Postgres Database from [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) ðŸš€

[Connect](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/postgres-connect/) to your database instance to run queries (ex. \dt).

```sh
fly pg connect -a <postgres-app-name> -d <db-name>
```

The [local connection](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/connecting/connecting-with-flyctl/)
to the database should first be enabled by tunneling the localhost port `5432`.
The command must be left running while the database is used. So do not close the
console!

```sh
flyctl proxy 5432 -a <postgres-app-name>
```
